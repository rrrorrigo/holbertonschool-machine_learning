    Early stopping should occur when the validation cost of the network has
    not decreased relative to the optimal validation cost by more than the
    threshold over a specific patience count

    opt_cost: is the lowest recorded validation cost of the neural network
    threshold: is the threshold used for early stopping
    patience: is the patience count used for early stopping

    followed by the updated count"""
